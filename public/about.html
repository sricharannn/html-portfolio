<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello. I am Sri Charan N. I am presently working in a Public Sector Bank in India. By the 4th November of this 2023
  I will be completing my 10 years of service in the Banking Sector. I worked in various capacities like Loans and 
  Advances officer, Operations officer, Deputy Branch Head and also as Audit officer.
</p>

<p>I did my Under Graduation in IT from Bapatla Engineering College, affliated to Acharya Nagarjuna University in 2011.
  I got placed into Igate-Patni company through campus placements, but due to lack of knowledge and preconceived notion
  about software industry I appeared for a Bank Officer exam and got selected. I completed by Post Graduate Diploma in
  Banking and Finance from Manipal Institute of Banking, Bengaluru in 2013 and also got my JAIIB certificate in the same
  year.
</p>

<p>It took me 10 precious years of my prime life to realise that I could gain nothing in Banking sector at the end of my
  service. Hence, started my journey towards a new goal. With my 10 years experience in Banking sector and a wroking
  knowledge of python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL I think I can move towards a new beginning.</p>
